# End to End Machine Learning project
 An end-to-end machine learning project typically involves several stages: data collection and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, deployment, and building a web application for prediction. I'll explain the steps involved in creating an end-to-end machine learning project to predict the scores of students using Flask and AWS.

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a dataset containing information about students, such as previous exam scores, study time, attendance, etc.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
Model Training and Evaluation:

2.Split the preprocessed dataset into a training set and a testing set.
Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression, decision tree, or random forest, for predicting student scores.
Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set, using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.
Deployment on AWS:

3.Create an AWS account and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
Set up an Amazon EC2 instance to host your Flask web application. Choose an instance type based on your needs.
Configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on the desired ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH and install necessary dependencies, including Python, Flask, and any additional libraries your application requires.
Building a Flask Web Application:

4.Create a Flask application by defining routes and views to handle different URLs and HTTP requests.
Develop a user interface for inputting student information, such as exam scores, study time, etc.
Write a prediction function that takes the user's input, preprocesses it, and uses the trained machine learning model to predict the student's score.
Display the predicted score to the user on a results page.
Hosting the Flask Application on AWS:

5.Set up a domain name for your application using Route 53 or another domain registrar.
Configure a load balancer and set up an Elastic IP address for your EC2 instance.
Deploy your Flask application to the EC2 instance and configure it to run as a web server.
Associate the domain name with the Elastic IP address of your EC2 instance.
Test your Flask application by accessing the domain name in a web browser.
